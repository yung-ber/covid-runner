# covid-runner
## fun endless runner I made for a talent show
sadly, i can't upload large files (files over 25mb) to github,
so, therefore, I have had to upload the project zip to google
drive and give you the link. I will eventually put the scripts
I used on this project, so don't worry!

**also: you can download this and play this just as if it were any other game! come on, just because it was for a talent show doesn't mean you cant play it!**
